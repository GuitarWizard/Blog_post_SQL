# Blog_post_SQL

Challenge:
Design a set of SQL tables for a blog. Include users, comments, blog posts, and any other objects
you feel are relevant. Please include comments for fields that might be unclear. MySQL is the
ideal database to target, but if you're not familiar with it, others are also acceptable.
