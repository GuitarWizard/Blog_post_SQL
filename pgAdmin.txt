create table site_users(

   email varchar not null,
   phone int not null,
   DOB int not null,

-- in the above query to generate the first table - the user_id is a unique identifier to each blog user, it is used by the database to
-- identify the user account, and is set up as a primary key to be utilized in the user_activity table.
-- The second item, user_name, is the display name. This does not have to be unique for allow flexibility for people with the same name
-- email address, for the user's contact information
-- phone number as an int to store numerical digits for account verification
-- Date of Birth to store the numerical values for MMDDYYYY.
-- finally user password 
-- All entry fields are mandatory

create table user_activity(
    post_head_id varchar unique not null,
    post_id varchar unique not null,
    user_id varchar REFERENCES site_users(user_id),
    post_date timestamp not null,
    post_content varchar(280) not null
)

-- in the user_activity table the following columns were created:
-- post_head_id: a unique identifier string to associate with the first posting in a comment chain. The post_head_id may be identical
-- to the post_id in cases where the user's post is the first in a chain of interactions
-- 
-- post_id: A unique identifier to the osted comment so that it may be referenced later - must be unique as id's cannot be shared across multiple
-- user actions. NOTE: "Post" would be the same as "comments" in this context
-- 
-- user_id - referenced from the site_user's table. This is used to tie the post_id to the specific user that created it.
-- post_date - the time that the post was made
-- post_content - the text string that was posted/tweeted, up to 280 characters.
